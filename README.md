Iris Classification Project ðŸŒ¸
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on petal and sepal dimensions.




ðŸ“Œ Project Overview--
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Use feature engineering to preprocess and scale data.
Train and evaluate machine learning models such as:
Logistic Regression,
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Decision Tree and Random Forest,
Visualize results using matplotlib and seaborn.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used--
Python,
Jupyter Notebook,
Pandas & NumPy,
Matplotlib & Seaborn,
Scikit-learn

ðŸ“Š Dataset Information--
Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
Target: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance--
Model Accuracy: 95%+ (depending on the chosen algorithm)
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
